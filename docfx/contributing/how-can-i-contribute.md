# How Can I Contribute

If you'd like to contribute to this repository, please read the following guidelines. Contributors are **more than welcome** to share their scripts with others in this centralized location.

## How can I contribute

There are ways to contribute:

* Create a scenario e.g. Upload a document to SharePoint, then add your script to the scenario
* Extend an existing scenario that does NOT have an example for the tool e.g. a scenario containing only CLI for Microsoft 365 sample, you can submit an updated scenario with a PnP PowerShell equivalent
* Logging an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/pnp/script-samples/issues) if you have feedback about the site or samples

To get started quickly, check out the [Preparing a submission guide](preparing-a-submission.md)

> *Please register your idea in the issue list and assign to yourself, there maybe others considering similar scripts.*

### Script Quality

In the PnP Script Samples, we do not place any specific quality requirements on the scripts themselves. To help guide you for suggested ways to present your scripts:

- Indent the scripts when encapsulating blocks in curly braces - this make it easier to read the blocks and understand the script
- Use comments, if you feel the script isn't clear by itself what it is doing. However, do not overload the script with comments either.
- Use good naming for variables to understand what is being stored
- Check the script works as you would expect it to, preferably include a screenshot of the end result, to help guide the reader.
- Remove any lines that show details of **your** tenant, e.g. usernames, passwords, URLs (replace with Contoso).

## Typos, Issues, Bugs and contributions

Whenever you are submitting any changes to the SharePoint repositories, please follow these recommendations.

* Always [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to your own account before making your modifications
* Do not combine multiple changes to one [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests). For example, submit any samples and documentation updates using separate PRs. If you do no worries, this is a preference to help us organize the PRs.
* If your pull request shows merge conflicts, make sure to update your local master to be a mirror of what's in the main repo before making your modifications. In your fork, GitHub shows a sync button to update your branch.
